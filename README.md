## Introduction:
The Nintendo Gameboy system is one of the most beloved devices of all time, selling a combined 118.69 million units worldwide, one of which ended up in the hands of my family. 

I have a lot of nostalgia for the system, and I figured creating an accurate simulation of the hardware would be an incredibly challenging yet fulfilling technical achievement.

## Goals:
  * Boot commercial games like Tetris and Pokemon Gold.
  * Custom Palette Support.
  * Save Support
  * Implement MBC1, MBC3, MBC5
  * Implement all instructions and pass the Blargg CPU unit tests.

## Planned Editions:
  * Real Time Clock Support
  * Implement Sound.
  * Implement Gameboy Color Compatibility.
  * Make a physical device using a Raspberry Pi Zero with a custom PCB and Casing.

## Challenges
