## Introduction:
The Nintendo Gameboy system is one of the most beloved devices of all time, selling a combined 118.69 million units worldwide, one of which ended up in the hands of my family. 

I have a lot of nostalgia for the system, and I figured creating an accurate simulation of the hardware would be an incredibly challenging yet fulfilling technical achievement.

## Goals:
  * Pass the blarrg CPU unit tests.
  * Boot commercial games like Tetris and Pokemon Red/Blue.
  * Implement reading/writing save files.
  * Implement Graphics.

## Planned Editions:
  * Implement the Pixel FiFo-based graphics system for perfect compatibility.
  * Implement Sound.
  * Implement Gameboy Color Compatibility.
