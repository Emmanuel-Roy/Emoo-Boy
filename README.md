## Introduction:
The Nintendo Gameboy system is one of the most beloved devices of all time, selling a combined 118.69 million units worldwide, one of which ended up in the hands of my family. 

I have a lot of nostalgia for the system, and I figured creating an accurate simulation of the hardware would be an incredibly challenging yet fulfilling technical achievement.

My Ultimate Goal with this project is for the emulator to run the following games from my childhood with near-perfect accuracy.
* Pokemon Gold and Silver
* The Legend of Zelda Links Awakening
* Kirby's Dream Land 2

## Goals:
  * Boot commercial games like Tetris and Pokemon Gold.
  * Custom Palette Support.
  * Save Support
  * Implement MBC1, MBC3, MBC5
  * Implement all instructions and pass the Blargg CPU unit tests.

## Planned Editions:
  * Real Time Clock Support
  * Implement Sound.
  * Implement Gameboy Color Compatibility.
  * Make a physical device using a Raspberry Pi Zero with a custom PCB and Casing.

## My Process and Challenges.

### Initial Background Renderer Attempt.
